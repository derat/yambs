# yambs (Yet Another MusicBrainz Seeder)

[![Build Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/derat-build-badges/666a3806-8543-471a-bd6c-d4b154f96082.svg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/derat-build-badges/666a3806-8543-471a-bd6c-d4b154f96082.html)

`yambs` is a command-line program for seeding edits to the [MusicBrainz] music
database.

It can simplify adding multiple standalone recordings: given a [CSV] or [TSV]
file describing recordings, `yambs` can open the [Add Standalone Recording] page
for each with various fields pre-filled.

`yambs` can also read `key=value` lines from text files to seed the [Add
Release] page, and it can use [Bandcamp] album pages and local MP3 files to seed
edits too.

There's a web frontend at [yambs.erat.org](https://yambs.erat.org).

## Installation

To compile and install the [yambs executable], install [Go] and run the
following command:

```sh
go install ./cmd/yambs
```

[yambs executable]: ./cmd/yambs
[Go]: https://go.dev/

## Usage

```
Usage yambs: [flag]... <FILE/URL>
Seeds MusicBrainz edits.

  -action value
    	Action to perform with seed URLs (open, print, serve, write) (default open)
  -addr string
    	Address to listen on for -action=serve (default "localhost:8999")
  -fields string
    	Comma-separated fields for CSV/TSV columns (e.g. "artist,name,length")
  -format value
    	Format for text input (csv, keyval, tsv) (default tsv)
  -list-fields
    	Print available fields for -type and exit
  -set value
    	Set a field for all entities (e.g. "edit_note=from https://www.example.org")
  -type value
    	Entity type for text or MP3 input (recording, release)
  -verbose
    	Enable verbose logging
  -version
    	Print the version and exit
```

`yambs` reads the supplied file or URL (or stdin if no positional argument is
supplied) and performs the action specified by the `-action` flag:

*   `open`: Open edits in a browser using a temporary file.
*   `print`: Write edit links to stdout (only possible for recordings).
*   `serve`: Open edits in a browser using a short-lived webserver launched at
    `-addr` (useful if you're running `yambs` in a container).
*   `write`: Write a webpage containing the edits to stdout.

If you supply a URL, `yambs` will fetch and parse it.

If you supply a filename, you should also pass the `-type`, `-format`,
`-fields`, and `-set` flags to tell `yambs` how to interpret the file.

### Examples

To add multiple non-album recordings for a single artist, you can run a command
like the following:

```sh
yambs \
  -type recording \
  -format tsv \
  -fields name,length,edit_note \
  -set artist=7e84f845-ac16-41fe-9ff8-df12eb32af55 \
  -set url0_url=https://www.example.org/ \
  -set url0_type=255 \
  <recordings.tsv
```

with a `recordings.tsv` file like the following (with tab characters between the
fields):

```tsv
Song #1	4:35	info from https://example.org/song1.html
Song #2	53234.35	info from https://example.org/song2.html
```

The recordings' names, lengths, and edit notes will be read from the TSV file,
and the `-set artist=...` flag sets all recordings' `artist` field to the
[specified artist](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/7e84f845-ac16-41fe-9ff8-df12eb32af55).

Likewise, the `-set url0_...` flags add a [URL relationship] to each recording.
[seed/enums.go] enumerates the different link types that can be specified
between entities; `255` corresponds to `LinkType_DownloadForFree_Recording_URL`.

[URL relationship]: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Relationships/URLs
[seed/enums.go]: ./seed/enums.go

---

To edit existing recordings, specify their [MBID]s via the `mbid` field:

```sh
yambs \
  -type recording \
  -format csv \
  -fields mbid,name \
  <recordings.csv
```

`recordings.csv`:

```csv
c55e74ff-bd7d-40ff-a591-c6993c59bda8,Sgt. Pepperâ€™s Lonely Hearts Club Band
...
```

Note that this example uses the `csv` format rather than `tsv`.

---

More-complicated artist credits can also be assigned:

```sh
yambs \
  -type recording \
  -format tsv
  -fields ... \
  -set artist0_mbid=1a054dd8-c5fa-40b6-9397-61c26b0185d4 \
  -set artist0_credited=virt \
  -set 'artist0_join= & ' \
  -set artist1_name=Rush \
  ...
```

(Note that repeated fields are 0-indexed.)

---

The `keyval` format can be used to seed a single entity across multiple lines:

```sh
yambs \
  -type release \
  -format keyval \
  <release.txt
```

`release.txt`:

```txt
title=Some Album
artist0_name=Some Artist
types=Album,Soundtrack
status=Official
packaging=Jewel Case
language=eng
script=Latn
event0_date=2021-05-15
event0_country=XW
medium0_format=CD
medium0_track0_title=First Track
medium0_track0_length=3:45.04
medium0_track1_title=Second Track
medium1_format=CD
medium1_track0_title=First Track on Second Disc
url0_url=https://www.example.org/
url0_type=75
edit_note=https://www.example.org
```

[seed/enums.go] shows that the `url0_type=75` line corresponds to
`LinkType_DownloadForFree_Release_URL`.

---

Pass the `-list-fields` flag to list all available fields for a given entity
type:

```sh
yambs -type recording -list-fields
yambs -type release   -list-fields
```

Acceptable values for various fields are listed in
[seed/enums.go], which is automatically generated from
[t/sql/initial.sql](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/t/sql/initial.sql)
in the [musicbrainz-server](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/)
repository.

You can pass Bandcamp album URLs to seed release edits:

```sh
yambs https://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/journey
```

The page that is opened will include a link to the album's highest-resolution
cover art to make it easier to add in a followup edit.

If you pass a Bandcamp track URL that isn't part of an album, an edit to add it
as a single will be created:

```sh
yambs https://caribouband.bandcamp.com/track/tin
```

---

You can pass the path to a local MP3 file to use it to seed a (single) release
or standalone recording edit:

```sh
yambs \
  -type recording \
  -artist0_mbid=7e84f845-ac16-41fe-9ff8-df12eb32af55 \
  -edit_note='from artist-provided MP3 at https://www.example.org/song.mp3' \
  /path/to/a/song.mp3
```

If the MP3 file contains embedded images, they will be extracted to temporary
files so they can be added as cover art.

---

There's also a [yambsd executable] that exposes most of the same functionality
through a webpage (with some limits to avoid abuse).

[yambsd executable]: ./cmd/yambsd

## Why?

There are a bunch of [MusicBrainz userscripts] that run in the browser with the
help of an extension like [Tampermonkey] to seed edits. They're well-tested, so
why not just use them instead of writing a new thing?

Well, at first I was adding a bunch of standalone recordings that I'd downloaded
from random musicians' homepages. I couldn't find any userscripts to help with
that, since the main focus seems to be seeding releases from major websites. I
ended up hacking together a shell script to generate URLs that would seed my
edits, but I figured it'd be nice to have something more robust and convenient
to use next time.

I had also been using the [bandcamp_importer.user.js] userscript to import
releases from Bandcamp, but I'm nervous about using extensions like Tampermonkey
that require permission to modify data on all sites. I'm not so worried about
malice on the part of extension or userscript developers, but I have no idea
about their security practices and I'm fearful of attackers compromising their
computers and uploading malicious versions of their code.

I created a separate browser profile that I could use to run Tampermonkey
without exposing any of my (non-MusicBrainz) credentials, but using it was a
pain, so I decided to add Bandcamp support to this codebase as well since
[that's where I get most of my music](https://www.erat.org/buying_music.html).
